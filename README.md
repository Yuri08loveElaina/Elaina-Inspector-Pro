# üß† Elaina Inspector Pro

**Elaina Inspector Pro** is a next-generation GUI toolkit for **reverse engineering**, **malware analysis**, **network forensics**, **hardware & firmware analysis**, and **automated exploit research** ‚Äî developed by the elite cybersecurity group **Elaina Core**.

The tool brings together static and dynamic binary analysis, packet capture and replay, crypto decoding, proxy interception, behavior detection, forensic recovery, and embedded firmware exploitation ‚Äî all in one unified platform.

## üß¨ Key Features

### üîß Reverse Engineering
- Disassemble x86/x64/ARM binaries using Capstone engine
- Hex viewer and patcher (modify opcode, insert NOPs)
- ASCII/Unicode string extraction
- PE/ELF header parser
- Decompiler integration (RetDec or external)
- Shellcode analyzer and translator
- Function scanner with basic symbolic flow

### ü¶† Malware Analysis
- Static malware profiling (headers, imports, entropy, strings)
- Dynamic analysis with API hooking and syscall trace
- Signature detection (Elaina Core DB)
- Auto behavior classification: downloader, injector, RAT, etc.
- Shellcode format decoder (raw, Base64, poly)
- Auto unpacker and emulator support (planned)

### üåê Packet Analysis
- Live packet capture via `libpcap`
- Protocol parser for TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, TLS, custom
- Import `.pcap` files and analyze packet flows
- Replay TCP/UDP packets to simulate attacks
- Automated payload extraction from session
- Exploit detection and redirect to RE tab

### üîì Proxy Interceptor
- Built-in HTTP/HTTPS proxy with request logger
- Integration with Burp Suite & OWASP ZAP logs
- Auto-analyze requests for vulnerabilities:
  - SQLi, XSS, RCE, LFI, SSTI, IDOR, CSRF
- Convert HTTP requests to fuzzers or exploits

### üì¶ Firmware Analysis
- Unpack embedded firmware images (binwalk-style)
- Analyze file systems (SquashFS, JFFS2, CramFS)
- Detect backdoors, hardcoded credentials, debug ports
- Emulate startup binary with QEMU (planned)
- Extract ELF from raw dumps and send to RE tab
- Identify IoT exploits and CVE-matching strings

### üß† Behavior Monitor
- Hook WinAPI / libc functions for live behavior tracing
- Syscall logging per process/thread
- Behavior scoring system (self-modifying, injection, beaconing)
- Real-time indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Timeline view of execution flow
- Auto label file as malicious/suspicious/benign

### üîê Cryptographic Analysis
- Detect and decode XOR, Base64, AES, RC4, DES
- Brute-force XOR keys or weak passwords
- Auto crypto detection engine (static pattern-based)
- Decrypt encoded payloads and embedded keys
- Integration with hash cracking (Planned: hashcat bridge)

### üîç Forensics & Log Analysis
- Recover deleted files from disk images
- Parse log files: Windows EVTX, Linux syslog, Apache logs
- Extract timeline of user/system activities
- Disk sector viewer and hex-level editor
- Registry dump viewer and analysis
- Supports NTFS, EXT4, FAT32 parsing

### ü§ñ AI & Automation
- Auto classify unknown binaries and payloads
- Suggest shellcode behavior (e.g., connect-back, download-exec)
- Auto-decrypt encoded payloads
- Behavior anomaly detection using heuristic + AI model
- ElainaScript AI plugin engine (planned)
- One-click full RE of unknown binaries
