# üß† Elaina Inspector Pro

**Elaina Inspector Pro** is a cutting-edge cybersecurity GUI toolkit combining **reverse engineering**, **packet analysis**, **malware detection**, **firmware analysis**, **digital forensics**, and **automated vulnerability research** ‚Äî developed by the elite Red Team unit **Elaina Core**.

Built in C with GTK3 and powered by Capstone, libpcap, and internal behavior engines, this tool is built for **security researchers, exploit developers, digital forensic analysts, and malware reverse engineers**.

---

## üö© What Is It?

> Elaina Inspector Pro is a comprehensive red-team toolkit to:
- Reverse engineer binaries and firmware
- Analyze and replay malicious network traffic
- Dissect and monitor malware behavior
- Intercept Burp/ZAP logs and convert to attack payloads
- Perform cryptographic analysis (XOR/AES/Base64/etc.)
- Automate exploit generation
- Perform forensic recovery and disk investigation
- Hook syscalls and monitor runtime behavior

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Elaina Inspector Pro integrates multiple cybersecurity analysis engines into a unified GUI interface. Its workflow can be summarized as follows:

1. **Input Handling:**  
   Users can load binaries (ELF, PE, firmware), network captures (PCAP), proxy logs (Burp/ZAP), or raw files for analysis.

2. **Static Analysis:**  
   The tool parses file headers, extracts strings, disassembles code using Capstone, and scans for suspicious signatures.  
   It auto-classifies file types (malware, shellcode, firmware).

3. **Dynamic Analysis:**  
   For supported binaries, API hooking and syscall tracing allow behavior monitoring during execution in sandbox or live environments.

4. **Network Analysis:**  
   Live traffic capture or PCAP replay enables extraction of payloads and suspicious network sessions.  
   Users can simulate attack replay or send suspicious payloads to the RE engine for deeper inspection.

5. **Automation & AI:**  
   Integrated heuristic engines and AI models classify threats, suggest exploits, and auto-decode encrypted payloads.  
   The tool provides recommendations to the analyst, speeding up triage and investigation.

6. **Forensics & Recovery:**  
   Disk and log analyzers allow recovery of deleted files, timeline reconstruction, and registry examination to provide contextual evidence.

7. **User Interaction:**  
   An intuitive GTK3 GUI organizes these capabilities into tabs (Reverse Engineering, Packet Analysis, Malware Lab, Firmware Analysis, Behavior Monitor, etc.) for seamless workflow.
